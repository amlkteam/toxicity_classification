# Team Contract

## Team Members: Amy, Nilan, Claire


### Work Distribution, Contribution and Quality

Each member is expected to work 9 hours per week, which is total 108 hours in four weeks for the project , and our project will be distributed in a fair and equitable way. Every group member is expected to contribute an equal amount of effort and time into the project. We will use daily "stand-ups" and try to divide tasks each week in a fair way in order to make sure that everyone in the group will spend roughly the same amount of time on the project. We are flexible with the assignments If one member takes more time which is not supposed to be, we will keep track of what's going on and make changes accordingly. Each member is expected to contribute an equal effort to make sure the work quality and members could send a brief message on Slack group chat to share information and keep other members updated. 

### Online Collaboration and Communication

For our online group meeting each week, we will use `Slack` to hold the group call or send message to each other and we could discuss the project in our group channel. If there might be any issue, we will choose `Zoom` as our backup since it is easy to conduct a group meeting. The GitHub repo was created by Nilan and he will handle the brach merges to master and other team members are expected to submit pull request to him and post a message on Slack to let him know.

The format of the meetings is basically through Slack and formal group discussion will be hold on every Tuesday from 2:00pm to 4:00pm during the COLX 585 lab time. We will list a set of goals each week and type out every members' deliverables, and also we will think about the general idea for the next week milestone outlines to ensure that our project goes smoothly. There are also some informal meetings and discussion during the weekdays basically though sending messages and group chat on Slack.  We basically will post questions, updates and useful resources in our Slack group, so each group member is expected to check Slack regularly and reply promptly if possible and ideally no later than 12 hours.

### Dealing with Team Member Unavailability

Since each person has their own lives, we are not expected team member either to work during weekends because of family obligations or be available 24/7. We will communicate each other about project tasks each week through Slack. We will make clear for each members' task and the deliveries at the beginning of each week. Under the current situation, it is hard to have the meetings in person, but we would like to try our best to finish weekly milestone on Friday. Therefore, if any group member has some questions and need to raise in time, others will have time to help out.

### Code of Conduct and Project Governance

We will be entirely democratic throughout the project, and we will not have a single project manager. We will follow the majority vote rule to make decisions together. Since we have three team members, that is to say, it allows us to vote for issues if there is a disagreement within the team.  Meeting online each Tuesday from 14:00 to 16:00 is elementary during the COLX 585 lab period through slack. Absence for some reasons is acceptable. 

We will have a plan to address any conflicts or issues if any team member fails to meet the expectations listed in the team contract or the project goal. Again reasonable explanations are accepted, since basically there is a reason why group member can't catch our goals and we are open to do the adjustments and have some changes to resolve any issues.
